      <p class="opener paragraph">
        I started working in UX design over 1 year ago. I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Hospitality Managment and soon found out that I was not interested in serving people in that capacity. I wanted to help people in a different way. In 2019 I started working as a contractor at a tech company in events, I was exposed to many different teams and that is where I learned about UX design.
        <br>
        I enrolled in the Google and Coursera UX design certification program last year to learn about UX desing. I found that I needed more school and am currently persuing an AA to build experience and enroll in a masters program soon. Welcome to my portfolio website!

        <h2> 2018</h2>
        <p>In 2018 I graduated from SJSU with a Bachelors in Hospitality Managment. I soon learned that in my last semester I didn't want to take on a career in hospitality. I wanted to look for a career in a different field, but didn't know where to start, I only had vauge ideas of industries I wanted to work in.</p>
